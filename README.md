# Unsafe [TBD]
## A Personal project applying some level design knowledge learned from College.

In short words, this is a small survival horror game where I try to apply the Level Design knowledge that I learned from the Level Design Classes (At least for the first levels).

(Spanish) You may want to check out the level document  to know more about the context of the level: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-loIP-UElHNaoIWc2IZPMFyuHISOaz2zF4e3bSzGzTI/edit?usp=sharing
